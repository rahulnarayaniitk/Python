# PythonLibraries
In this course, I will cover basic Python libraries, which are crucial to moving forward in the field of Data Science.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a crucial step in the data analysis process where you visually and statistically summarize, interpret, and examine the main characteristics of a dataset. EDA helps you understand the underlying structure of your data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights that can guide your subsequent data analysis or modelling decisions. There are several Python libraries that are commonly used for performing EDA effectively. Here are some of the key libraries:

1. **Pandas:**
   Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides the DataFrame and Series data structures that allow you to load, clean, transform, and explore data easily. With Pandas, you can perform basic summary statistics, filtering, grouping, and data transformation.

2. **NumPy:**
   NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. While not explicitly for visualization, NumPy is often used for data manipulation before generating visualizations.
3. **Matplotlib:**
   Matplotlib is a versatile 2D plotting library that allows you to create various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar plots, and more. It's highly customizable and widely used for creating visualizations in EDA.

4. **Seaborn:**
   Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations, including heatmaps, pair plots, and distribution plots.

5. **Plotly:**
   Plotly is a library that supports interactive, web-based visualizations. It's particularly useful for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations that allow users to explore data on their own.

6. **Scipy:**
   Scipy builds on NumPy and provides additional functionality for scientific and technical computing. It includes modules for statistics, optimization, signal processing, and more, which can be useful for more advanced EDA.

8. **StatsModels:**
   StatsModels is a library for estimating and interpreting statistical models. It's useful for performing various types of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing during EDA.

9. **Yellowbrick:**
   Yellowbrick is a visualization library specifically designed to complement Scikit-learn and other machine-learning libraries. It provides tools for visually diagnosing and understanding machine learning model behaviour and performance during EDA.

When performing EDA, you might use a combination of these libraries to explore your data from different angles and create informative visualizations. By utilizing these libraries, you can gain deeper insights into your data, identify trends, outliers, and relationships between variables, and make more informed decisions when building models or making business decisions based on the data.


## **Scikit-learn**

  Scikit-learn is a widely used machine learning library in Python that provides tools for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. While Scikit-learn is not primarily designed for data visualization, it plays a significant role in the overall data analysis process, especially when transitioning from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building.
  
  While Scikit-learn's primary focus is on machine learning algorithms, its integration with the broader data analysis ecosystem, including libraries for data manipulation and visualization, makes it an essential component in the process from data exploration to model deployment. Combining Scikit-learn with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others can create a comprehensive workflow for analyzing data, building models, and making data-driven decisions.
